# Strawberries-maduration-detection

This repository contains a work of the subject "Computer Vision" of the Computer Engineering course of the University of Huelva (UHU).

The work consists of an application developed in Matlab where several supervised learning models are tested to obtain a strawberry detection based on its color. 

The degree of maturity of a strawberry will be measured by dividing the number of red pixels by the number of total pixels that make up the cluster.

Different supervised learning models (KNN, NN, SVM and mahalanobis distance) along with different color descriptors (RGB, Lab, RSL, HSIUab) have been tested. The KNN and RGB combination has been chosen for the application since it has the best metrics.
